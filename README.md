# machine-learning-final-project
Final project code and documentation
## Overview
This project is the culminations of the machine learning that I have been working on for the past semester. Originally I was going to try and work with data regarding insurance company policies and using machine learning to find some sort of identification as to the policies that need reviewing, this proved difficult when tasked with finding real data that included the correct values for my target data. I have since changed the project to take demographic information from the US Census and try to determine a county's median income based on the percentage of the population of that county being in difference field of work. Below are some updates as I was working as well as links to the other documents containing the necessary information for the project. 
### Updated: Proposal
Check the proposal now as it is different than when I first submitted it. I will now be using differnent data.

### Code Complete:
Both initial exploration and linear regression are complete. I will note that I would have liked to use many more predictors but ran into an error not letting me use certain features. Hopefully in the future I will have solved this. 

### Update: 4/3/2019  
Milestone 2 complete with some slight problems:
1. My decision tree and svm were not working with multiple feature in the set so I only used one.
2. The code was eating my laptop's memory like it was a snack. I'm not sure if the classifiers are supposed to be that intentive, but I do have a dataset with over 70000 entries. To summarize the models so far, I would say that the linear regression performed better just due to the fact that the code worked and I could uses multiple linear regression to find a model that had a decent R^2 value. The decision tree and the svm took a great deal of time to fit the data as well.
