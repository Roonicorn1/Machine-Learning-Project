Final project code and documentation

## Updated: Proposal
Check the proposal now as it is different than when I first submitted it. I will now be using differnent data.

## Code Complete:
Both initial exploration and linear regression are complete. I will note that I would have liked to use many more predictors but ran into an error not letting me use certain features. Hopefully in the future I will have solved this. 

## Update: 4/3/2019  
Milestone 2 complete with some slight problems:
1. My decision tree and svm were not working with multiple feature in the set so I only used one.
2. The code was eating my laptop's memory like it was a snack. I'm not sure if the classifiers are supposed to be that intentive, but I do have a dataset with over 70000 entries. To summarize the models so far, I would say that the linear regression performed better just due to the fact that the code worked and I could uses multiple linear regression to find a model that had a decent R^2 value. The decision tree and the svm took a great deal of time to fit the data as well.
