Final project code and documentation

## Updated: Proposal
Check the proposal now as it is different than when I first submitted it. I will now be using differnent data.

## Code Complete:
Both initial exploration and linear regression are complete. I will note that I would have liked to use many more predictors but ran into an error not letting me use certain features. Hopefully in the future I will have solved this.
