# RAW_DATA
The data I will go over today is data from the [2015 US Census](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data#acs2015_county_data.csv)  
This data comes from a well-known dataset website called Kaggle. I found this data just searching through Kaggle looking for data that I could use some machine learning tricks on.
