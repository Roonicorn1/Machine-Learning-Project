# CONCLUSIONS  
Throughout the project the goal has been clear; clean, classify, and interpret a dataset using machine learning techniques. With the use of a Linear Regression Model I was able to take demographic data from the US Census and process it into a model that could predict the median income of a county given the percentage of people who worked in the fields: Professional, Service, Office, and Construction. The model suggests that the Professional jobs have the most impact on median income. This is likely due to Professional jobs having a tendancy to pay higher wages/salaries than jobs in the other categories. Office was the next most important feature with Service and Contruction being the least of the features in terms of impact.
