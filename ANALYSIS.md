# ANALYSIS  
The following is the technical analysis of the data and the links to the models used in the shaping the data.  
## Final Model  
[Linear_Regression](linear_regression.ipynb)  
This model was chosen based on the fact that it fit the data the best. When compared to the other models like the Decision Tree and the SVM, the Linear Regression model had a better time fitting the data and also didn't eat my laptop's RAM like the other 2 models. 
## Trial Models
[Classification](Classification.ipynb)  
These are included for credibility, I did not just choose regression as a cop out. I tried out the other models and they did not work well for the data I chose.
